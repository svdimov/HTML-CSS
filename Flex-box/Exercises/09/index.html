            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were
                features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and
                frustrating.
            </p>
            <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any
                kind of convenient, flexible way:
            </p>
        </div>


        <ul class="list">
            <li class="text">
                <p>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li class="text">
                <p>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height,
                    regardless of how much width/height is available.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li class="text">
                <p>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different
                    amount of content.
                </p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="text">
            <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!

        <h1 class="title">Greetings from Narnia!</h1>
        <p class="text">
          I hope this finds you well! Narnia is even more magical than I imagined. The landscapes are breathtaking, and I've met the most fascinating creatures, including Aslan himself. Every day here is an adventure. I visited Cair Paravel and was awed by its beauty. I wish you could see it with me! Sending you lots of love and a touch of Narnian magic. Can't wait to share my stories when I return.
